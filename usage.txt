-------------------------
ExcludeFasta.pl
-------------------------

Excludes the sequences identified in a user supplied list from the FASTA file
supplied by the user.
Usage: ExcludeFasta.pl list input > output
Where:	list:	a list of sequence IDs
	input:	a FASTA file containing multiple sequences.
	output:	a name for the output file (all sequences from input not named in list)

-------------------------
FastaStats.pl
-------------------------

Summarizes length statistics for a set of DNA sequences.
Usage: FastaStats.pl input.fasta

-------------------------
IncludeFasta.pl
-------------------------

Excludes the sequences identified in a user supplied list from the FASTA file
supplied by the user.
Usage: IncludeFasta.pl list input output
Where:	list:	a list of sequence IDs
	input:	a FASTA file containing multiple sequences.
	output:	a name for the output file (all sequences from input not named in list)

-------------------------
RandomDrawFastq.pl
-------------------------

Draws the specified number of sequences randomly from an input FASTQ file.
Usage: RandomDrawFastq.pl input num_seq output

-------------------------
RandSeqGen.pl
-------------------------

Generates random sequences (DNA or protein, as specified by the user).
Usage: RandSeqGen.pl number option length type output
	(e.g. RandSeqGen.pl 10 r 200 DNA random_dna.fasta)
Where:	number =	number of sequences to generate.
	option =	f for fixed, uniform length, r for random lengths.
	length =	average length of random sequences.
	type =		DNA or protein.
	output =	a name for the output file.

-------------------------
SeqLengthDist.pl
-------------------------

Summarizes length distribution for a collection of DNA sequences (FASTA)
Usage: SeqLengthDist.pl input max_bin bin_size
Where:	input:	FASTA-formatted file containing multiple DNA sequences.
	max_bin:	sequences longer than this will all be counted in the largest bin.
	bin_size:	size of each bin in bp.

-------------------------
unique_fastq.pl
-------------------------

Extracts unique sequences from a fastq file, eliminating duplicated records.
Usage: unique_fastq.pl input.fastq output.fastq
Where:
	input.fastq:	FASTQ input file.
	output.fastq:	a name for the output file, a FASTQ file without any duplicated records.
